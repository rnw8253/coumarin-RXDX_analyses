# coumarin-RXDX_analyses
These are analyses used for this publication:
Weber, R., & McCullagh, M. (2020). The Role of Hydrophobicity in the Stability and pH-Switchability of (RXDX)4 and Coumarin-(RXDX)4 Conjugate β-Sheets. Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 124(9), 1723–1732. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c00048

There are two folders containing analyses performed on systems with coumarin and systems without coumarin

In the directory of analyses performed on the system with coumarin (coumarin_RXDX) there are four folders containing scripts to calculate the:
1) Pair distribution function (PDF) of coumarins within the fiber
2) Analyses to calculate the bend and twist angles of the fiber along multiple axes of the fiber
3) Solvent accesible surface area (SASA) of the coumarin sidechains
4) Helical parameters between each pair of coumarins within the fiber

In the directory of analyses performed on systems without coumarin (RXDX) there are four folders containing scripts to calculate the:
1) Define secondary structure analysis (DSSP) which calculates secondary strcuture of each residue or of the total system based on hydrogen bonds
2) Interaction energy (IE) between each residue type 
3) Solvent accesible surface area (SASA) of the hydrophobic residues
4) Density of specific atom types along the axis perpendicular to the fiber plane
